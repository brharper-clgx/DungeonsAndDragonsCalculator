## Explanation of Functions
### DC Calc
The difficulty class calculator is intended for DMs. The DM specifies the likelihood (as a percentage) that a task is successfully completed and the DC Calc displays an appropriate difficulty class for that likelihood.

There are options for rolling with advantage, disadvantage, and modifiers. However, it is recommended that these options are not used (i.e., Adv and Dis are unchecked, and mod = 0). This way the difficulty class represents a objective difficulty that a character's particular attributes and circumstances may overcome (it would be odd, for example, if a stealthy monk and clamorous paladin had the same likelihood of sneaky past a battalion of guards). However, these features were included for the edge cases in which those factors needed to be considered.

### EV Calc
The EV Calc is primarily intended for players. It calculated the expected value of a dice roll. Say you are trying to decided between using an axe which does 1d10+2 damage, or a revolver which does 3d4 + 5 damage. The EV Calc will tell you that on average you can expect each weapon to do the same amount of damage (7.5 points). However, your three throwing stars,  which do 3d6+0 damage, have an expected value of 10.5 points and are thus the best choice (in terms of damage dealt).

## Future Upgrades
If I ever get around to it I'll add the ability to save character stats and do stat based rolls.
