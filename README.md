## Explanation of Functions
### DC Calc
The difficulty class calculator is intended for DMs. The DM specifies the likelihood (as a percentage) that a task is successful and the DC Calc displays an appropriate difficulty class for that likelihood.

There are options for rolling with advantage, disadvantage, and modifiers. However, use of these options is not recommended (i.e., leave Adv and Dis are unchecked, and mod = 0). Without these options the difficulty class represents an objective difficulty that a character's particular attributes and circumstances may overcome (it would be odd, for example, if a stealthy monk and clamorous paladin had the same likelihood of sneaky past a battalion of guards). However, these features were included for the edge cases in which those factors need to be considered.

### EV Calc
The EV Calc is primarily intended for players. It calculates the expected value of a dice roll. Say you are trying to decided between using an axe that does 1d10+2 damage, a revolver that does 3d4 + 5 damage, and throwing stars that do 3d6+0 damage. The EV Calc will tell you that the expected damage of the axe and revolver are both 7.5 while the throwing stars will do an average of 10.5 damage, making the throwing stars the most effective option. 

## Future Upgrades
If I ever get around to it I'll add the ability to save character stats and do stat based rolls.
